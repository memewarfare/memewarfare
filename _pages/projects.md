**WORDS** is a monthly journal of Bitcoin commentary. For the uninitiated, getting up to speed on Bitcoin can seem daunting. Content is scattered across the internet, in some cases behind paywalls, or even lost forever. That’s why we made this journal, to preserve and further understanding of Bitcoin.

## Goals and Scope
**WORDS** is a journal of Bitcoin commentary, established February 13, 2019. It's purpose is to document and advance commentary and research in disciplines of particular interest to the Bitcoin community. The journal is broad in scope, publishing content from original research, essays, blog posts, and tweetstorms from a wide variety of fields, especially technology, philosophy, politics, economics, and finance, but also legal theory, history, criticism, and social or cultural analysis. Its broader mission is to capture the conversations and think pieces in the Bitcoin space for current and future researchers.

## History
There exists a gap in Bitcoin publishing.  For authors with commentary and scholarly papers on Bitcoin topics, the choice of publication outlets is relatively limited. The number of journals that serve as outlets for Bitcoin research is in any event too small, as the number of Bitcoin thinkers continues to grow with every market cycle.

This generation of Bitcoin thinkers have limited places to submit thought pieces for publication. Content is scattered across the web, and in some cases behind paywalls which prevent the free flow of information. With the advent of Twitter and blogging, authors also now have the option of self-publishing: they post the content to their own site or a private site, link it in a blog post, or post a working paper. But this is obviously not the best way to document and publish. What is needed is a journal that takes full advantage of the possibilities of the digital age as a go to resource for think pieces in the Bitcoin space. 

Enter **WORDS**. Published independently, **WORDS** is a journal that welcomes submissions on a range of topics of interest to the Bitcoin community.  In addition to conventional research articles, we welcome review essays blog posts, tweets as well as papers in other formats, such as distinguished lectures. Authors retain ownership without restriction of all rights under copyright in their articles. **WORDS** is open access, and we encourage readers to “[read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles… or use them for any other lawful purpose.](https://doaj.org/faq#definition)”. This is an archival project on a mission to capture the spirit and voice of the Bitcoin community for future generations.
