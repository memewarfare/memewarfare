**WORDS** is a monthly Bitcoin journal. Each journal is a collection of articles, essays, and tweets from the Bitcoin community for that month. Journals are distributed monthly via email newsletter and on Twitter. There are hundreds of subscribers. You should sign up too - apparently it's pretty good.
