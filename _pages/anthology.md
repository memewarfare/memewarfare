**WORDS** is a monthly Bitcoin journal. Each journal is a collection of articles, essays, and tweets from the Bitcoin community that month. Journals are distributed monthly via email newsletter. There are hundreds of subscribers. You should sign up too - apparently it's pretty good.

## About the Anthology Collection
The amount of quality writing about Bitcoin is growing at a rapid pace. Since this project began, certain thinkers have consistently shared their thoughts and I decided to curate their work in a journal. As always, this is a work in progress. The journals will likely be updated over time as more content is created by the authors and will be added. 

Thanks for reading. Be sure to support the authors and consider sharing this project with a friend.
