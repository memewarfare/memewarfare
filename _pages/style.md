# Anchors
We will want to make anchors to cross link to specific places in notes. 

[Link to On-Mutation](https://listed.to/@joerodgers/16188/notes-on-the-viral-aspects-of-language#on-mutation).

Essentially you will place an anchor `<a name="on-mutation">On Mutation</a>` in the document, then you can navigate to that place in the document by adding `#on-mutation` to the end of the page URL. 

`https://listed.to/@joerodgers/16188/notes-on-the-viral-aspects-of-language#on-mutation`

```
<a name="on-mutation">On Mutation</a>
```

# Quotes

> To be or not to **be**,

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

# Code

Some text with an inline `code` snippet


or here is an example of a code block:

```
.my-link {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

# Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
:--- | :---: | ---:
*Left* | `center` | **right**
1 | 2 | 3

insert text here

| Syntax      | [Description](#) | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |
